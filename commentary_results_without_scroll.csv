18.6,1,"Morea to Russell,  1 run","That's all she wrote! Russell takes West Indies over the line as he digs out a yorker towards long on. West Indies start their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign with victory by five wickets! But my days did they have to work for it! Outstanding fight from PNG, who, truth be told, were ahead of the game on a couple of occasions during this chase but just couldn't stay the course. Plenty of ""if only"" moments but they've shown the rest of Group C that they're not just here for the ride..."
18.5,1,"Morea to Chase,  1 run","Wide yorker, ramped out to third to tie the scores..."
18.4,4,"Morea to Chase, FOUR runs",One bouncer four over cover! Start the car. Morea serves up a full toss outside off stump and Chase gets it out of the middle with a lovely lofted cover drive
18.3,4,"Morea to Chase, FOUR runs","Flicked over the shoulder for four! Chase steps across and intercepts a full ball on the sweep, lapping it fine on the leg side"
18.2,1,"Morea to Russell,  1 run","Russell steps across to expose his stumps, Morea goes for the toes - on about off stump - and is picked away for a single through midwicket"
18.1,2,"Morea to Russell,  2 runs","Wide yorker, dug out with a horizontal bat down to third. No real pace on the delivery allows deep cover to run around to third and field"
17.6,4,"Vala to Chase, FOUR runs","Flatter, back of a length - powered down the ground for another boundary! The 18th over goes for 18, as Chase stands tall into that lofted drive. Quality"
17.5,6,"Vala to Chase,  SIX runs","Bang! The ideal release shot for Chase, who presses forward and drives gloriously up and over long off, from low to high"
17.4,1,"Vala to Russell,  1 run",Driven out to that deep fielder on the off side
17.3,2,"Vala to Russell,  2 runs","Length played off the back foot, punched into deep cover. Great running from Russell puts pressure on the fielder who throws down the middle of the pitch"
17.2,1,"Vala to Chase,  1 run",Worked out to deep midwicket
17.1,4,"Vala to Chase, FOUR runs","Back to back boundaries! And how necessary they were... Vala drags another down but doesn't get away with it as Chase flicks it around the corner. In fact, Vala should have got away with it, because the fielder running around from backward square leg got to the ball but didn't get low enough to gather and ends up getting nutmegged"
16.6,6,"Kariko to Russell,  SIX runs",That's one of them! Enough sighters for Russell - winds up and hooooons a full delivery on the strikes high and handsome over square leg
16.5,2,"Kariko to Russell,  2 runs","Driven on the up to midwicket, two made with ease as Siaka has to run about 30 yards to his right from long on to gather"

16.2,1,"Kariko to Chase,  1 run","Shorter, this time Chase waits a little and punches beyond that cover fielder"
16.1,•,"Kariko to Chase, no run","Darted in, just off a length, well-timed drive but straight to cover"
15.6,W,"Vala to Rutherford, OUT","GOT HIM! The good news for Rutherford is this time he doesn't cut into the ground. The bad news is he's cut straight into right thigh of the keeper Doriga, who ends up keeping the ball in the air and completing the catch. PNG - are you really about to do this?!"
15.5,•,"Vala to Rutherford, no run","Darted into a length, Rutherford duffs a cut into the ground once more"
