1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.6,1,"Morea to Russell,  1 run","That's all she wrote! Russell takes West Indies over the line as he digs out a yorker towards long on. West Indies start their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign with victory by five wickets! But my days did they have to work for it! Outstanding fight from PNG, who, truth be told, were ahead of the game on a couple of occasions during this chase but just couldn't stay the course. Plenty of ""if only"" moments but they've shown the rest of Group C that they're not just here for the ride..."
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.5,1,"Morea to Chase,  1 run","Wide yorker, ramped out to third to tie the scores..."
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.4,4,"Morea to Chase, FOUR runs",One bouncer four over cover! Start the car. Morea serves up a full toss outside off stump and Chase gets it out of the middle with a lovely lofted cover drive
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.3,4,"Morea to Chase, FOUR runs","Flicked over the shoulder for four! Chase steps across and intercepts a full ball on the sweep, lapping it fine on the leg side"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.2,1,"Morea to Russell,  1 run","Russell steps across to expose his stumps, Morea goes for the toes - on about off stump - and is picked away for a single through midwicket"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,18.1,2,"Morea to Russell,  2 runs","Wide yorker, dug out with a horizontal bat down to third. No real pace on the delivery allows deep cover to run around to third and field"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,17.6,4,"Vala to Chase, FOUR runs","Flatter, back of a length - powered down the ground for another boundary! The 18th over goes for 18, as Chase stands tall into that lofted drive. Quality"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,17.5,6,"Vala to Chase,  SIX runs","Bang! The ideal release shot for Chase, who presses forward and drives gloriously up and over long off, from low to high"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,17.1,4,"Vala to Chase, FOUR runs","Back to back boundaries! And how necessary they were... Vala drags another down but doesn't get away with it as Chase flicks it around the corner. In fact, Vala should have got away with it, because the fielder running around from backward square leg got to the ball but didn't get low enough to gather and ends up getting nutmegged"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,16.6,6,"Kariko to Russell,  SIX runs",That's one of them! Enough sighters for Russell - winds up and hooooons a full delivery on the strikes high and handsome over square leg
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,16.5,2,"Kariko to Russell,  2 runs","Driven on the up to midwicket, two made with ease as Siaka has to run about 30 yards to his right from long on to gather"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,15.6,W,"Vala to Rutherford, OUT","GOT HIM! The good news for Rutherford is this time he doesn't cut into the ground. The bad news is he's cut straight into right thigh of the keeper Doriga, who ends up keeping the ball in the air and completing the catch. PNG - are you really about to do this?!"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,14.5,6,"Amini to Chase,  SIX runs","Flighted wide of off stump, slog-swept into the stands at midwicket! Quality shot from Chase, who finally gets one out of the screws"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,14.4,1,"Amini to Rutherford,  1 run",On the up back to the bowler... but just beyond his dive! Rutherford had hard hands into that but it was too far from Amini to be considered a chance

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,13.5,•,"Soper to Powell, no run","Bit of nibble away from the right-hander off a length, squares up Powell a touch, but adjusts in time to offer more of his bat than simple the edge"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,13.3,1,"Soper to Powell,  1 run","Into a length, angled into the hip, Powell gets on top of the bounce and takes the single on offer at midwicket"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,12.5,1,"Kariko to Powell,  1 run",Fired down leg but intercepted by Powell who is leaning forward feeling for the ball. He might have done well to leave it alone for a wide rather than the single he picks up to midwicket

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,11.3,4,"Vala to Powell, FOUR runs","Dragged down, slapped to deep backward square leg and beats the fielder diving just in front of the sponge! The fielder got around in time and should have gathered cleanly"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,11.2,•,"Vala to Powell, no run","Short of a good length, patted down the ground by Powell who was on the move"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,9.5,W,"Vala to King, OUT","The King is gone! That's a gorgeous piece of bowling - flighted, slower too, asking to be heaved to the short side.

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,8.6,•,"Kariko to Chase, no run","Past the outside edge! Held that one bit, extracted a bit of turn off the pitch and had Chase feeling for the ball outside off stump. Tidy over from the 20-year-old"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,8.1,W,"Kariko to Pooran, OUT","Gone! Big wicket as Kariko bags Pooran, but it has been coming... Pooran was again down the pitch, but the length wasn't there. He carries on with the heave and ends up plopping it to the fielder out at wide long on, who ends up taking the catch a good 10 or 15 yards in front of the boundary"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,7.6,•,"Soper to King, no run","Full, on off stump, driven to cover once more"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,7.5,1,"Soper to Pooran,  1 run","Into the pads of the left-hander this time, full and tucked away behind square leg"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,7.4,1,"Soper to King,  1 run","Onto the pads again, this one punched to midwicket with more force meaning the fielder from cow corner fields and keeps them to one"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,7.3,2,"Soper to King,  2 runs","Fuller, into the pads, worked away to a vacant midwicket meaning the keeper has to scurry out from behind the stumps to collect"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,6.6,2,"Kariko to Pooran,  2 runs","Deft touch from Pooran, who offers his bat as a ramp to guide down to third as Kariko darts this last delivery in. Good hustle from the fielder chasing from the circle, who clasws the ball back to save two"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,6.2,•,"Kariko to Pooran, no run","Gets away with that one, dragged down from over the wicket. Pooran tries to help it on its way, but under-edges into the pitch"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,5.6,•,"Bau to Pooran, no run","Flatter, into the pitch, Pooran tries to slap shot this once more but ends up scuffing into the ground. And that brings the Power Play to an end. A brilliant start followed by an ominous end as Pooran looks to have found his touch"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,5.5,1,"Bau to King,  1 run","Bit of turn with this off break, tucked away off the pitch, into midwicket, for a single"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,5.1,6,"Bau to Pooran,  SIX runs","Skips down, launches it into the Pavilion! Gorgeous swing from Pooran, straight and true. He was always charging that delivery, and, thankfully for the batter, it was right in the slot"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,4.6,4,"Soper to King, FOUR runs","Edged! But away beyond the keeper for another boundary to King. Throws everything behind a drive to a ball that isn't as full as anticipated. Even if first slip was in, he'd have to be very fine to have any chance of taking that to his left"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,4.4,2,"Soper to Pooran,  2 runs","Heaved to the leg side by Pooran... but the ball plus and Vala goes to collect. No real timing by Pooran, who is trying to hit himself into form on this deck"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,4.3,•,"Soper to Pooran, no run","Better line and length, into the top of off stump from over the wicket. Pooran tries to drop this into point for a run but no dice"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,4.2,•,"Soper to Pooran, no run","Short of a length, almost does Pooran with the lack of pace as he the leftie gets a thick outside edge away to third, who is up"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,4.1,•,"Soper to Pooran, no run","Starts full, on the pads and deflects out into the leg side"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,3.6,4,"Nao to King, FOUR runs","Laced through point! Smart batting from King; knows a correction of sorts is coming, and when Nao is fuller with that same width, just throws his hands through the ball, opening the wrists a touch, and bagging his sixth boundary"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,3.5,4,"Nao to King, FOUR runs","There it is! Nao opts for a wider delivery anticipating the charge, which duly comes. This time, King's weight is perfect - head still - and he powers that through the covers"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,3.4,•,"Nao to King, no run","Charge... and another miss! Nao nips this one into the right-hander, off a length, and ends up cutting King in half as he skips down the track"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,3.2,•,"Nao to Pooran, no run","Length, straightening off the deck, Pooran is down on one knee trying to blaze this one into the sea and misses completely. Ends up having to wear it instead"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.6,1,"Morea to Pooran,  1 run","Length away, not as much swing, allowing Pooran to open his hands into a push, getting off the mark with a single down to third up in the circle"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.5,•,"Morea to Pooran, no run","Good length, swing away, left alone by Pooran"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.4,1lb,"Morea to King, 1 leg bye","Swing again from a full length, kicked around the corner by King whose front foot interrupts his bat flow"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.3,4,"Morea to King, FOUR runs","Too wide, clubbed through point! Presses forward, rocks back and cuts with ease"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.2,•,"Morea to King, no run","Straighter, swinging in, off the inside edge and into the front pad. Great comeback from Morea"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,2.1,4,"Morea to King, FOUR runs","Driven on the up... and flies through the gap between cover and mid off! Width on offer, from a fuller length, and King is never going to say no to that"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,1.6,•,"Nao to Pooran, no run","Swing and a miss! Lovely delivery, arching in a touch, nipping away late, enticing a flourish from Pooran. It's taken a bit of time to completely, but an excellent wicket maiden from Nao"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,1.5,•,"Nao to Pooran, no run","A charge first ball... but Pooran accidentally turns the delivery into a yorker. Ends up inside edging the ball onto his boot and to fine leg, who is up in the circle. Thinks about a run but King sends him back"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,1.4,•,"Nao to Pooran, no run",Another LBW appeal.... this time Umpire Rashid Riaz shakes his head. No review and wise from PNG as that looks to have pitched outside leg stump before hitting the front pad... Oh no! It did pitch in line! and it was set to be hitting the stumps flush! Oh dear oh dear - what might have been...
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,1.3,•,"Nao to Pooran, no run","Great line, same again, decent length to ensure Pooran can't come forward, who lets this one go too"

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,1.1,W,"Nao to Charles, OUT","Big LBW appeal... Given! Charles reviews straightaway but that looks pretty adjacent...

1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,0.6,4,"Morea to King, FOUR runs","Short, not quick enough and powered well in front of square leg!"
1415702,2,C,West Indies,Papua New Guinea,2,0.5,4,"Morea to King, FOUR runs","That's what he wanted to do! King's on the move, Morea's line is straighter and a cautious lofted drive down the ground brings about the first boundary of the chase"
