1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,11.6,W,"Alzarri Joseph to Nsubuga, OUT","there it is, a whopping 134-run victory for the West Indies! And this is also the joint-lowest team total in the men's T20 World Cup! Length ball in and around off stump. Nips back in a shade with the angle and beats Nsubuga for pace, who anyway had a half-hearted poke at it. Top of off stump is rattled, and that sums up what has been a terrific bowling performance!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,10.6,W,"Motie to Kyewuta, OUT","another big appeal, and another batter falls to the arm-ball! This has been WI's biggest bowling weapon tonight. The ball starts just outside off before coming in with the angle. Kyewuta does not get a big enough stride and does not pick the variation either. Plays all over it and the ball clips the flap of the back leg right in front of middle stump. Kumar Dharmasena raises his finger, and Kyewuta does not bother with the review!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,10.5,1,"Motie to Miyagi,  1 run","nearly! Tossed up on a length outside off. Miyagi reaches out for it and jabs it uppishly, just past the diving Powell at short extra cover"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,6.5,W,"Hosein to Waiswa, OUT","five of the very best for Akeal Hosein! Another arm-ball that starts outside off and zings back into Waiswa. Like many before him, he has no idea about this. Plants his front foot and then plays outside the line. The ball sneaks past the inside edge and thumps him on the front pad.

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,6.1,W,"Hosein to Nakrani, OUT","classic left-arm spinner's dismissal! Floated up on a length outside off. Plenty of revs on this and the ball drops very late on Nakrani. He stretches out, trying to smother it but is nowhere close to the pitch of the ball. The ball grips in the surface too and bursts through the gap between bat and pad. Beautiful bowling!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,5.6,•,"Alzarri Joseph to Waiswa, no run",length delivery outside off that shapes away nicely. Waiswa wafts at it but misses it by quite some distance

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,4.4,W,"Hosein to Riazat Ali Shah, OUT",hot knife through butter! Another arm-ball and Riazat is the latest to fall to it. Does not pick it at all and tries to cut.

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,2,1.3,W,"Shepherd to Sesazi, OUT","soft dismissal! Fullish just outside off and buoyed by the last ball, Ssesazi goes after this.
