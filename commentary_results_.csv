1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.6,2,"Ali Khan to Movva,  2 runs","Driven down the ground, they scamper back before the throw from long-off comes through. Movva's charge gives Canada a 21-run over to finish off the innings"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.5,6,"Ali Khan to Movva,  SIX runs","That's the flat-bat at its imperious best. Creamed wide of long-off, Steve Smith-esque from Movva, who makes a bit of room and belts the shortish ball on the top of the bounce"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.4,4,"Ali Khan to Movva, FOUR runs","Movva's quick hands power the ball through the line again. Ali misses the yorker only by a bit Movva clears the front leg, gets into the stablest of bases and drives it straight"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.4,1w,"Ali Khan to Movva, 1 wide","Bumper goes down leg, Movva tries to hook it but misses. Keeper lobs the ball up too high, no threat of byes though"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.3,1,"Ali Khan to Heyliger,  1 run","Bumper over leg stump, batter makes room and charges. Doesn't middle the pull but gets it to long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.2,1,"Ali Khan to Movva,  1 run",Lands the yorker near the crease this time. Clips it to deep fine leg
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,19.1,6,"Ali Khan to Movva,  SIX runs",Misses the yorker by a little bit and Heyliger punishes it. Lifts it from shin-height and gets it straight of long-off for a 76-metre six
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.6,1W,"Anderson to Bajwa, 1 run, OUT","They look to sneak another two, throw is in at the keeper's end. Bails dislodged, decision sent upstairs. Bajwa dove forward... but is a few inches short. Bajwa had heaved it to the right of long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.5,•,"Anderson to Bajwa, no run","Canada haven't been able to pull off the unconventional shots. Bajwa changes his guard and winds up big for the reverse sweep, commits fully but the full ball outside off beats him"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.4,6,"Anderson to Bajwa,  SIX runs","The sound off the bat on that pull is pure!. Bajwa was ever so ready for the slower half-tracker angling in towards fourth stump. Got upright and hauled it over midwicket, 89-metre six. Proper biggie"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.3,4,"Anderson to Bajwa, FOUR runs","Goes across, gets inside the line and essentially sweeps the length ball in the gap to the right of square leg. No one in the deep there"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.2,1,"Anderson to Movva,  1 run",Goes through with the lofted cover drive but is a bit too early into it. Ball lands safely in front of long-off
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,18.1,2,"Anderson to Movva,  2 runs",Gous runs back... and can't take it. He started from square leg and was late to pick up where the ball was going and that cost him distance.
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.6,•,"Ali Khan to Bajwa, no run",Slower bumper is outside off and Bajwa tries to slap it with the cross bat. Misses
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.5,W,"Ali Khan to Kirton, OUT","Full ball has been skewered to cover, Kirton tried to end Canada's boundary-drought by lifting the full ball with an open face but couldn't get under the ball. Front leg was out the way, he got inside the line a bit too mucb as well. Hits it straight to Anderson"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.4,1lb,"Ali Khan to Movva, 1 leg bye","Movva makes room and Ali follows him with a very full ball, close to the block-hole with the batter's movement. Beats the flick and the ball deflects off the pad to the off side"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.4,1w,"Ali Khan to Movva, 1 wide","Late call of wide leaves the keeper, and USA's skipper, unimpressed. Was a shortish ball, and Movva walked towards it real late and tried to reverse-pull it. Beaten. The movement across the crease hasn't helped the batters of late"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.3,1,"Ali Khan to Kirton,  1 run","Ali nearly nails the wide yorker and all Kirton can do is slice it to deep-backward point. 135ks, lands just in front of the crease"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.2,•,"Ali Khan to Kirton, no run","Goes for the reverse ramp and misses. Kirton went square-on, got his feet wide apart and tried to help the full ball, angling through fifth, between keeper and short third"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,17.1,1,"Ali Khan to Movva,  1 run","Pitched up, driven hard but finds mid-on. Ball went along the ground"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.6,2,"Anderson to Kirton,  2 runs","Very tight two to backward square leg and Movva makes it, raises fifty too . He raises his bat. Was a slower bumper that was pulled gently and into the ground. Fielder charged in and threw well but the batter was quicker"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.5,•,"Anderson to Kirton, no run",Kirton shapes for the pull but yoinks his shoulder down to sneak a wide. Not given though. The bouncer was angling down but was too close to the batter
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.4,2,"Anderson to Kirton,  2 runs","Goes back in the crease and pulls. But Anderson doesn't give pace again, finds the edge but the ball again, doesn't carry. Long-on stops it on the bounce"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.3,1,"Anderson to Movva,  1 run","Movva tries the swindle again but the line of the ball is at the stumps and he holds sway, drives down the ground. Not middled but lands safely"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.2,•,"Anderson to Movva, no run",Walks down and Anderson goes wide and slow. Movva speed walked and wanted to use he pace in his attempt to mash the ball over cover but met with air
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,16.1,1,"Anderson to Kirton,  1 run",Pulls the length ball to long leg. Brings up Canada's 150
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.6,4,"Jasdeep to Movva, FOUR runs","Movva goes leg side before swindling the bowler. Finishes wide of off, gets square-on and scoops it over his bending shoulder. Was a fullish ball that was on the rise, making it all the more impressive"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.5,1,"Jasdeep to Kirton,  1 run","Length on leg, clipped to backward square leg"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.4,4,"Jasdeep to Kirton, FOUR runs","Nice use of the angle from Kirton. Was a length ball around off, he hopped leg side to make a bit of room and cut it late. Got it in the gap behind point for four"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.3,1,"Jasdeep to Movva,  1 run","Shortish ball around fourth is pulled to long-on. Didn't time it well, might have been the splice"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.2,1,"Jasdeep to Kirton,  1 run","Full on middle and leg, 124ks, clipped to the left of long-on. They were thinking of two but Kirton couldn't turn properly. Didn't look like two was on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,15.1,1,"Jasdeep to Movva,  1 run","Length on leg, clipped to deep square leg's left"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.6,1,"Anderson to Movva,  1 run","Length just outside off, pushed to deep point"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.5,1,"Anderson to Kirton,  1 run","Length outside off, guided to backward point"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.4,2,"Anderson to Kirton,  2 runs","That could be one of the great pick-up-and-throw run outs. Even if not, that's a heck of effort from Anderson, who ran towards the unmanned midwicket region, saw the non-striker's end as the danger one and changed direction. He was rotating, which meant he couldn't get the power behind the throw, and that has given Movva time to make it back. Dive helped too. Was a length ball that was clipped off the back foot, Anderson ran about 20 metres to the left"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.3,4,"Anderson to Kirton, FOUR runs","Bumper just over the waist, from over the wicket. Kirton swivels from off side to leg on the pull, was cramped for room a bit but went through with the pull, got it fine for four"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.2,1,"Anderson to Movva,  1 run","Length on off, clipped through midwicket. Man from the deep runs in and keeps it to one. Anderson almost collided with the non-striker but both players look in good spirit in the end"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,14.1,W,"Anderson to Dhaliwal, OUT","Anderson's first ball in the WC for USA dismisses the well set Dhaliwal. Cutter on a full length angling in and he tried to lash it through the line. The lack of pace meant he was into the shot too early and got it off the bottom of the bat, ball popped straight to Jasdeep at long-off. Again, a good innings from an opener"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.6,2,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  2 runs","Square driven off the back foot, should be four... No! Johnson races to the right from deep-backward point and dives to keep it to two"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.5,2,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  2 runs",Length ball is clipped across to long-on
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.4,4,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton, FOUR runs",Overpitched and that's driven firmly through the line. Four down the ground. Technically perfect from Kirton
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.3,6,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  SIX runs","Dipping low full toss has been elevated over cover with panache. Looks like a missed yorker, was angling away towards fourth stump, Kirton's front foot was arrowing towards long-on's direction and his upper body collapsed a bit to access it, somehow got the timing just right on the bat swing"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.2,1,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Full on leg, clipped to long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,13.1,1,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  1 run","Slow on a length, dances down while making room and slaps it to long-off"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.6,4,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, FOUR runs","A bit of room this time and Dhaliwal dances down, coils his body and bashes it wide of long-off. Harmeet, who was economical for most of his spell, ends up conceding back-to-back boundaries"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.5,4,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, FOUR runs","Cannoned down the ground, Kirton has to duck for cover. Harmeet went foot and slow, ended up tossing up a slot ball at the stumps. The back lift was high as it was threatening, the contact on the drive was sweet and long-on had no chance"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.4,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Confident stumping appeal. Sent upstairs. Length ball at 86ks, Dhaliwal went for the sweep. HIs foot did drag out as he played the shot but then returned as he lunged back. That helps him get a part of his foot back inside"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.3,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Dances into the pitch of the 97ks ball, punches it back to the bowler"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.2,1,"Harmeet Singh to Kirton,  1 run","Length on leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,12.1,1,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Harmeet keeps it slow and out of Dhaliwal's arc. 81ks, very full and around the off-side tramline. The batter reaches out and oars it over cover"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.6,1,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Slower one on a length just outside off, stabbed to short third. Dhaliwal took off right after making contact, which has been a recurring theme tonight"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.5,1,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  1 run","Length on fourth, 122ks, square driven off the back foot to deep cover's left"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.4,1,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  1 run",Carves it off the back foot through the off side. The single brings up Dhaliwal's fifty and Canada's hundred
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.3,6,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  SIX runs","Lumped down the ground. This was overpitched and at the stumps, Dhaliwal got leg side of the ball and smoked it through the line. Was like a shot Carlos Brathwaite hit during the 2016 final, forced it a bit but got enough muscle to hit it 74 metres far"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.2,1,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  1 run","Length around off, driven to long-off"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,11.1,2,"van Schalkwyk to Kirton,  2 runs","Batters rush for the single. In fact, Ali misfields at short fine leg and that allows two. Was an offcutter on a length at leg stump that was flicked late"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.6,•,"Netravalkar to Dhaliwal, no run","Length ball over middle and off, defended to the bowler's left"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.5,1,"Netravalkar to Kirton,  1 run","Length on fourth, worked off the back foot to long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.4,1,"Netravalkar to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Fullish on leg, clipped through backward square leg"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.3,2,"Netravalkar to Dhaliwal,  2 runs","Pitched up and a bit of room given, Dhaliwal chips a drive over extra cover and picks up two. Holds his shape well"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.2,•,"Netravalkar to Dhaliwal, no run","Slow on a length, from around the wicket. Defended in front"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,10.1,1,"Netravalkar to Kirton,  1 run","Length on leg, clipped through midwicket"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.6,•,"Taylor to Dhaliwal, no run","Probably the best ball of the over. Length on fourth, 98ks, worked back to the bowler"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.5,1,"Taylor to Kirton,  1 run","Fullish length ball outside off is slowish, gets good bounce. Tapped with an open face to short fine"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.4,1,"Taylor to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Better from Taylor. Length on middle, 97ks, clipped off the back foot towards wide long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.3,6,"Taylor to Dhaliwal,  SIX runs","Canada are taking on the offie. This was a slot ball at the stumps and Dhaliwal lines up the part-timer, strides towards the pitch and drives through the line. Ball sails over long-on"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.2,1,"Taylor to Kirton,  1 run",Cuts the wide-ish ball to the off side
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,9.1,6,"Taylor to Kirton,  SIX runs","High-full toss is somehow munched over cover for six! Kirton was backing away but got one around the waist, 97ks, and he went through with the slashing cut shot despite being cramped for room a bit. Just cleared the cushion"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,8.6,1,"Harmeet Singh to Kirton,  1 run",Driven down the ground for a single
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,8.5,•,"Harmeet Singh to Kirton, no run","Full ball is slow and drifts in towards off, defended"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,8.4,1,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Dances down, gets to the pitch of the wide-ish ball and drives to deep cover"

1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,8.2,•,"Harmeet Singh to Kirton, no run","Tries to cut the length ball outside off, gets beaten"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,8.1,1,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal,  1 run",Quick single to short third. Was a length ball that was slapped
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.6,1W,"van Schalkwyk to Pargat Singh, 1 run, OUT","Pargat returns for a risky second, accurate throw from Jasdeep and the keeper does well to whip off the bails. Run-out referral made. This could be out. Yep, he's a goner despite the full-length dive!. Monank got the throw angling at him, he swayed his hands to the right and dislodged the bails with the batter being about a foot short. Was a length ball that was flicked around the corner, off the back foot. Jasdeep ran to the right and flung the ball at pace. A very flat and fast throw"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.5,•,"van Schalkwyk to Pargat Singh, no run",Pargat doesn't get the bounce he wanted for the square drive and gets beaten. Falls over too. Length ball on fifth
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.4,2,"van Schalkwyk to Pargat Singh,  2 runs","Clipped off the hip, deep-backward square leg runs to the right and cuts it off. Quick outfield but quicker running allows the batters to take two"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.3,1,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Another quick single. Was a length ball at the pads, Dhaliwal inside edges the flick and the ball rolled towards the vacant short-leg area"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.2,1,"van Schalkwyk to Pargat Singh,  1 run","Slow again. Full on off, Pargat leans down towards the ball and taps it to forward point"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,7.1,1,"van Schalkwyk to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Slower one is fullish and outside off, pushed with the open face to point"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.6,1,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal,  1 run",Driven off the front foot through the off side for a single
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.5,4,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, FOUR runs",So much flair in that bosh over extra cover. Dhaliwal stays leg side of the length ball over off and smears it over the in-field. Held his shape really well on the drive there
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.4,•,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, no run",Aims for something similar but has to check the shot due to the room being lesser. Defended to cover in the end
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.3,4,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, FOUR runs",Makes a bit of room and carves it in the gap behind point. Was a length ball around fourth stump and Dhaliwal's hand speed through the ball was impeccable
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.2,•,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, no run","Three-quarter length on off, driven to mid-off"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,6.1,1lb,"Jasdeep to Pargat Singh, 1 leg bye","Big appeal for lbw, not given. Jasdeep chats with the skip, USA decide to review. Good shout but height might be an issue. Was a length ball that angled in, beat the flick and hit over the knee-roll. Hawk-Eye projects that the ball would have gone over the top of the stumps"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.6,6,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal,  SIX runs","Dhaliwal diffuses the pressure, dances down and flays it wide of long-off. Was taken on the up but the flat bat allowed enough surface area to middle it. Not that bad a ball despite the width (given Dhaliwal's charge)"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.5,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Length ball follows the batter as he made room, punched off the back foot to cover"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.4,1,"Harmeet Singh to Pargat Singh,  1 run","Lot happening, Nitish almost took a stunner running to the left from long-off. He then bulleted a throw to the keeper, who whipped off the bails but Dhaliwal made it. Quite cool how the fielder caught it on the bounce while sliding. Was a full ball that was flighted and driven inside out"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.3,•,"Harmeet Singh to Pargat Singh, no run","Full on middle and off, defended to cover"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.2,W,"Harmeet Singh to Johnson, OUT","Slapped off the toe of the bat and it's taken at long-off! Harmeet slowed down the pace after predominantly darting the ball so far, Johnson backed away and tried to belt it off side, but made a bit too much room and lost balance. He was falling over leg side and the bat was going the other way. Easy catch and Harmeet is jubilant. The opener gave his side a good start though"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,5.1,•,"Harmeet Singh to Johnson, no run","A bit of turn in beats the bat, lbw appeal is turned down."
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.6,•,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, no run","Jasdeep closes out the over well, almost had a wicket but the ball goes on the bounce to mid-on. Was a hard-length ball just outside the ball that Dhaliwal wanted to drag across with the pull"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.5,•,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal, no run",French cut goes past leg stump. Not far. Was a length ball outside off and Dhaliwal wanted to crash it square on the off side
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.4,2,"Jasdeep to Dhaliwal,  2 runs",Dhaliwal shows all the stumps and walks into the full ball going down leg to whip it through midwicket. Stopped deep in the outfield. 138ks
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.3,1,"Jasdeep to Johnson,  1 run","Back of length around fifth, guided to deep-backward point off the back foot. Ian Bishop says this is a better length for the pitch, any shorter and the pull shot can be played"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.2,•,"Jasdeep to Johnson, no run","Full around off, 135ks, driven to mid-off"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,4.1,•,"Jasdeep to Johnson, no run","Shortish ball beats the pull. Scramble-seam ball lands around fifth and decks back in a bit, Johnson stood tall and didn't get the bounce he wanted"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.6,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Taylor stops four at backward point. Length ball is wide and Dhaliwal committed to the square slash, it was racing to Taylor's right but he dove across and intercepted"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.5,1,"Harmeet Singh to Johnson,  1 run","A bit of low bounce and Johnson tucks the shortish, slow ball from the stumps to midwicket. Gets a quick single, had to hurry but makes it"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.4,1,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal,  1 run","Fullish just down leg, Dhaliwal dances down and drives to long-off"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.3,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Darted at leg peg, it's fullish and is defended in front"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.2,4,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, FOUR runs","Dhaliwal backs away, rocks back and drives off the back foot through cover. He started to go on the front foot but read the length and decided to go back later. Ball came at an easy pace and the outfield is rapid"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,3.1,•,"Harmeet Singh to Dhaliwal, no run","Fullish and flat. Dhaliwal dances down, gets close to the pitch and punches it to the bowler's left. Harmeet leaps across and parries it to the left"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,2.6,•,"Ali Khan to Johnson, no run","Dot to finish but it's a 17-run over. Length on fifth, defended with an open face to backward point"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,2.5,4,"Ali Khan to Johnson, FOUR runs","Bad ball. Too straight and the length ball is glanced fine. Johnson, and Canada, are off to a flier"
1415701,1,A,United States Of America,Canada,1,2.4,4,"Ali Khan to Johnson, FOUR runs","The bouncer doesn't put Johnson off, he takes a really big front-foot stride and reaches out to the wide scramble-seam length ball, lifts it over the infield with an open face. Gets four to the forward-point boundary"

Omarzai tries to hit it into next week and loses all shape. Cuts across it too much and the ball skews off the outside half of the bat. Ramjani gets under it at extra cover and makes no mistake!"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,19.4,1,"Kyewuta to M Nabi,  1 run","full and wide outside off again. Nabi, sitting deep in his crease, can only smash it straight to extra cover. Just a single"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,19.3,•,"Kyewuta to M Nabi, no run","appeal, not given! Very full and wide outside off. Nabi gives it all he has and seems to miss it. There was a sound, though, and that got Uganda interested. Was it bat hitting the ground or was it an edge? We go upstairs to find out. Clear gap between bat and ball, and the sound was of the bat hitting the turf. Nabi stays!"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,19.2,2,"Kyewuta to M Nabi,  2 runs","off-pace and into the track outside off. Nabi almost swings himself off his feet and the miscue trickles away behind square, allowing him to come back for two"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,19.1,1,"Kyewuta to Azmatullah,  1 run",length ball on the stumps. Omarzai swings like a rusty gate and shanks it towards deep mid wicket

1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,17.2,•,"Kyewuta to Gulbadin, no run",length ball hung up wide outside off. Naib has a wild swing at it and misses. Was just inside the tramlines and hence was not called a wide

Uganda waited an eternity for their first wicket, and they now have three!. Seems a bit of a drag-down but the key thing is that there is no real room to work with for Najib. He swings at it anyway but because he cannot free his arms, he picks out Nakrani at deep square leg. Replays confirm it was an off-spinner angled into Najib!"

1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,14.6,1lb,"Masaba to Gurbaz, 1 leg bye","another similar length ball, sliding into the pads. Gurbaz plays all over it and the ball trickles towards backward point for a leg bye"

Flighted up deliciously on a length on leg stump. Ibrahim looks at the flight and hares down, only to realise he has been deceived in the air. Gets nowhere close to it and the ball sneaks back in with the angle, clipping the pad before thudding into leg stump. A superb knock, though, and that has set Afghanistan on their way to a big score!"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,14.2,•,"Masaba to Ibrahim Zadran, no run","back of a length, following the batter just outside leg. Does not spin and comes in with the arm. Ibrahim shanks it back to the bowler"

Back of a length outside off. Ibrahim gives himself room and lofts it towards long off. The fielder runs to his left, gets both hands to it but spills it. The ball then seems to roll away into the cushion. The fielder, thinking the ball is still in play, got it back to the bowler's end, where Gurbaz was scrambling to complete the run. Ended up with a blow on the right knee for his toil!"
1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,1,13.1,5w,"Bilal Hassun to Ibrahim Zadran, 5 wide",oh dear! Sprays this a mile down leg and the keeper cannot get close to it either. Five extras added to Afghanistan's total!

1415705,5,C,Afghanistan,Uganda,2,15.5,W,"Rashid Khan to Bilal Hassun, OUT","that looks plumb! Googly on a length on off. Bilal, having not had enormous success with the conventional, now tries the reverse, rather ambitiously. Makes a complete hash of it and gets thumped on the front pad in front of off stump. Kumar Dharmasena gives it out but we go upstairs for a final ratification. No bat involved, and Ball Tracking has the ball smashing into middle stump, two-thirds of the way up!"

Fizzed through on a length on middle and off. This is the leg-spinner and it turns away just enough to beat the bat and smack Bilal on the back leg. The swiftness of the review, however, suggests there might have been bat involved. That is indeed the case. A big outside edge, and Bilal stays!"

Skids off the surface and Obuya, who dangles his bat, gets a healthy edge. Gurbaz claimed the catch, having dived forward but the umpires just want to be sure if this has carried.

Stirling looks to heave this length ball on middle and leg over square leg, but gets a leading edge that goes quite high.

Breezes past his bat to knock back the stumps, and Uganda are just two wickets away from bowling PNG out!"

Doriga gets down on one knee and has a yahoo across the line. Misses it completely and gets rapped on the back thigh. The umpire is not interested, but Uganda are, and they review.

Three reds and Doriga is outta here!"

No bat involved, like it was in Vala's case. Ball Tracking comes up and it reckons the ball would have gone over leg stump. Ura survives!"

Naib has a massive mow across the line but has to fight the angle from over the wicket. Cannot control the pull and he skews it towards Phillips at deep mid wicket, who gobbles up the chance!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,19.4,1,"Boult to Karim Janat,  1 run",full and zipped into the pads again. Janat swishes and misses and Afghanistan have to settle for another leg bye
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,19.3,1lb,"Boult to Gulbadin, 1 leg bye","appeal! Very full delivery that seems to pitch just outside leg. Naib plays all over it and the ball rolls away off the pads. Boult, though, is interested in the lbw and convinces Williamson to go upstairs. The key question here is where this ball pitched. If it pitched in line, it could be curtains for Naib. Ball Tracking confirms the ball pitched outside leg and Naib survives. Afghanistan get the leg bye too!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,19.2,W,"Boult to Gurbaz, OUT","Gurbaz gets cleaned up by Boult! Sizzling yorker on off stump that Gurbaz does not have a riposte for. He is late in picking it and the ball whistles past his bat before it comes down. Looks on in disbelief at what Boult has produced but he is not the first (or the last) to be castled by Boult. A passage of play Afghanistan might not look back at too fondly, although this innings was of the highest order!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,19.1,W,"Boult to Rashid Khan, OUT",Rashid sacrifices his wicket! Nails the yorker outside off first up. Rashid cannot jam his bat down in time. Gurbaz is hell-bent on regaining strike and almost runs past Rashid before the Afghanistan skipper decides to sacrifice himself to keep the set batter on strike. Easy relay to Boult and he takes off the bails at the bowler's end!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.6,6,"Mitchell to Gurbaz,  SIX runs",pick the bones out of this one! And watch out on the road too! Mitchell goes for a yorker outside off but ends up bowling a slot ball. Gurbaz bends his back knee to get under it and clatters it onto the roof over long off. Holds the pose too after that 105m six!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.5,1,"Mitchell to Rashid Khan,  1 run","slower full delivery outside off. Rashid, because of how slow it is, cannot get the timing he is after and shanks it to long on"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.4,1,"Mitchell to Gurbaz,  1 run",in the slot just outside off. Gurbaz tries to hit it into next week and drags it towards deep mid wicket
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.3,1,"Mitchell to Rashid Khan,  1 run",another off-pace delivery into the track on middle and leg. Rashid waits an eternity for it before swiping it off the top edge into his helmet
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.2,1,"Mitchell to Gurbaz,  1 run",slower delivery dug into the track outside off. Gurbaz nearly swings himself off his feet and miscues it towards deep square leg. Gurbaz is livid with himself
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,18.1,6,"Mitchell to Gurbaz,  SIX runs","into orbit! In the slot and guess what happens to those - they go miles! Gurbaz sits deep in his crease, swings through the line and launches it over long on. A 93m six!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.6,•,"Ferguson to Rashid Khan, no run",short and wide outside off. Rashid has another swish at it but is just a little late on the stroke this time. A fresh-air shot
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.5,4,"Ferguson to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs",flies away for four! Sharp shortish delivery outside off. Rashid throws the kitchen sink at it and slashes it away fine past the keeper!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.4,W,"Ferguson to M Nabi, OUT","stop the press, New Zealand have taken two catches in two overs! Another attempted yorker that ends up as a full toss just outside off. Nabi tries to turn it to leg but closes his bat face too early. Spoons up off the leading edge and Williamson does the rest at mid off. Very soft dismissal!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.3,1,"Ferguson to Gurbaz,  1 run",into the blockhole outside off. Gurbaz shuffles across and tucks it off his toes towards deep square leg
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.2,4,"Ferguson to Gurbaz, FOUR runs","back to back fours! Juicy full toss outside off and that is not great bowling. Might have been a leg cutter that went wrong, although it does not matter to Gurbaz, who just pops it over mid off!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,17.1,4,"Ferguson to Gurbaz, FOUR runs","four to start the over! Back of a length on off. Gurbaz dances down the track and lofts it over the bowler's head. Mitchell did put in the dive, running to his left from long on, but cannot stop the boundary!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.6,W,"Henry to Azmatullah, OUT","Henry gets rid of Omarzai! Seems like a slower ball, bowled at around 127kph. Pitches on a full length on middle and off, tempting Omarzai to go inside out. The bat face, though, opens upon contact and he cannot generate the power he is after. Slices it towards deep cover point, where Ferguson holds on. A useful cameo, though, and it has given Afghanistan the continuity they needed after that opening stand!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.5,6,"Henry to Azmatullah,  SIX runs",six more! Fractionally short on middle and leg. Omarzai reads the length like the morning daily and dumps it over the deep mid wicket fence!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.4,•,"Henry to Azmatullah, no run","cutter on a back of a length just outside leg. Omarzai backs away, trying to access the off side but only swishes at thin air"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.3,6,"Henry to Azmatullah,  SIX runs",fetch that! Banged in short outside off and Omarzai is waiting for it. Stands up tall and pummels this over the deep square leg fence!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.2,•,"Henry to Azmatullah, no run",length on middle and off. Omarzai has a swing at it but ends up jamming it off the inside edge into his pads
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,16.1,1,"Henry to Gurbaz,  1 run",off-pace and into the track on leg stump. Gurbaz hangs back and pulls it towards deep square leg
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.6,2,"Santner to Azmatullah,  2 runs",angled in on a back of a length on leg stump. Omarzai bunts it to the edge of the ring in the mid wicket region and has ample time to complete two
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.5,4,"Santner to Azmatullah, FOUR runs",up and over! In the slot on middle and off. Omarzai is now aware of what Santner is trying to do and gives himself room. Goes through the line and crashes it over extra cover!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.4,•,"Santner to Azmatullah, no run",fullish on middle and off. Straightens off the surface again and Omarzai edges it towards short third
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.3,•,"Santner to Azmatullah, no run",some turn! Tossed up on a length outside off. Drops on the batter late and then rips away past the outside edge as Omarzai looks to go inside out
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.2,1,"Santner to Gurbaz,  1 run",full on off. Gurbaz advances and perhaps gets too close to the ball. Shanks it down to long on
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,15.1,1,"Santner to Azmatullah,  1 run",fired in full on middle and off. Omarzai lunges forward and pushes it to long off
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.6,1,"Henry to Azmatullah,  1 run",short outside off. Omarzai gets on top of the bounce and cuts it towards deep cover point. Retains strike
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.5,•,"Henry to Azmatullah, no run",jaffa! Back of a length in the channel just outside off. Nips away a smidgen and breezes past the outside edge of Omarzai's bat
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.4,2,"Henry to Azmatullah,  2 runs","shortish on the body. Omarzai uses the pace, gets inside the line and glances it down to fine leg for a brace"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.3,W,"Henry to Ibrahim Zadran, OUT","chops on the very next ball! NZ finally have a wicket! Dug in shorter and this is just a hint outside off. Ibrahim backs away, trying to muscle it over extra cover. Swishes at it too early, though, and the ball skews off the bottom edge into leg stump. Ibrahim throws his head back in disappointment. No real celebration from NZ, but they have something to show for their toil tonight!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.2,•,"Henry to Ibrahim Zadran, no run",ouch! Banged into the track on leg stump. Ibrahim gets cramped for room and cannot get out of the way as the ball keeps coming back into him. Thuds into the grille and that will have shaken Ibrahim
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,14.1,1,"Henry to Gurbaz,  1 run","it is just not happening for New Zealand! Hard length outside off. Gurbaz has a swing at it but the ball gets awfully big on him. Slices it up and the ball loops up. Backward point, third man and the keeper go after it but it falls bang in the middle of the three"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,13.6,1,"Santner to Gurbaz,  1 run",fired in on a length on the pads. Gurbaz tucks it away into the mid wicket region. Santner tears after it and prevents the second
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,13.5,•,"Santner to Gurbaz, no run","slowed up a little and darted into the pads, after seeing Gurbaz advance. He cannot do much with it and the ball pings him on the thigh pad"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,13.4,•,"Santner to Gurbaz, no run",slanted in on a back of a length on middle and leg. Skids on with the arm and hurries Gurbaz on the pull. Chops it into his pads
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,13.3,1,"Santner to Ibrahim Zadran,  1 run",fullish outside off. Ibrahim stretches forward and pushes it towards deep cover point
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,13.2,1,"Santner to Gurbaz,  1 run","back of a length on middle and off. Sticks in the surface and Gurbaz stabs it towards Santner, who misfields and allows a single"

1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.6,•,"Boult to Ibrahim Zadran, no run",off-pace and dug into the track outside off. Ibrahim cannot come to grips with the slowness and scuffs it towards extra cover
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.5,1,"Boult to Gurbaz,  1 run",slow and short on leg stump. Gurbaz waits for it and hacks it towards deep square leg. Brings up his second fifty in as many games at this T20 World Cup!
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.4,1,"Boult to Ibrahim Zadran,  1 run",short on leg stump. Ibrahim gets on top of the bounce and pulls it towards deep backward square leg
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.3,1,"Boult to Gurbaz,  1 run","hard length on middle and off. Gurbaz stabs it back to Boult, who gets a hand to it and parries it close to the stumps. That is enough for Gurbaz to pinch a single, though"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.2,6,"Boult to Gurbaz,  SIX runs","that is a shot and a half! Banged into the track outside off. Gurbaz marches down the track, stands tall and flat-bats it over Boult's head!"
1415714,14,C,Afghanistan,New Zealand,1,12.1,2,"Boult to Gurbaz,  2 runs",hard length just outside off. Gurbaz eases it out towards deep point. Afghanistan threaten the second and that forces Chapman to throw it at the bowler's end. The throw is a little erratic and Boult cannot rein it it. Afghanistan eventually get the second
