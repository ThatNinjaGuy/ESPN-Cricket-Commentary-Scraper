1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,19.1,1W,"Jansen to Theekshana, 1 run, OUT","full on off, mistimed heave down the ground. They look to run two, but mid-off running back sends in a gun throw and Thushara is well short. Sri Lanka are bowled out for 77, it's their lowest ever T20I score"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.6,1,"Baartman to Theekshana,  1 run","full and straight, worked down to long-on for one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.5,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run",Swing and a miss! Short outside off. Quicker and steeper than the last one as Theekshana misses
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.4,4,"Baartman to Theekshana, FOUR runs",Put away as a big cheer goes up! Sits up from a short of a length and Theekshana clobbers this pull wide of long-on
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.3,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run",swing and a miss as this short one zips through
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.2,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","short of a length on the stumps, worked briefly in the air towards the vacant midwicket. Theekshana is looking to farm the strike but Thushara is already haring away. He's almost at the batting crease before being turned back. Could've run two there honestly"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,18.1,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","full outside off, Theekshana clears that front leg and swings. Beaten on the outside edge"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.6,•,"Rabada to Thushara, no run",This time Thushara takes the blow on his pads. Full but angling past leg as Thushara moves away once more. He really isn't keen on being anywhere near the ball
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.5,•,"Rabada to Thushara, no run","Again moves away, ball hits bat rather than the other way around"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.4,•,"Rabada to Thushara, no run","good length, angled in towards leg. Thushara though is very eager to move out of the way, ball hits high on the bat"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.3,•,"Rabada to Thushara, no run","low full toss, angled in on leg. Kept out"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.2,W,"Rabada to Pathirana, OUT","Top edge and taken easily at mid-on! This was full on middle and leg, Pathirana gets a leading edge as he looks to work it onside. Ends up going high but not very far. Sri Lanka are 9 down"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,17.1,•,"Rabada to Pathirana, no run",Makes room and swings hard. Misses by a wide margin as this bounces over off stump
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,16.6,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","Back of a length wider of off, Theekshana pokes at it and misses"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,16.6,1w,"Baartman to Theekshana, 1 wide","full and slips down leg, wide given. Well kept"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,16.5,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","And again! Just too good for Theekshana, who just can't get bat on it"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,16.4,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","good length, 133kph, seams away a touch and beats the outside edge as well as off stumps."

1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,16.1,•,"Baartman to Theekshana, no run","good length on off, gets behind the line and defends"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.6,•,"Nortje to Pathirana, no run","Swings and misses! Good length just outside off, and Theekshana gets nowhere near it"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.5,•,"Nortje to Pathirana, no run","Well directed yorker, and well kept out by Pathirana as well"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.4,W,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews, OUT","And now Sri Lanka's last bastion of hope also perishes! This was shorter and quicker, rushes Mathews on the hook. Top edged and it's straight to Baartman at fine leg"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.3,•,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews, no run","Swing and a miss! Full and slow, 118kph, from the back of the hand. Mathews is way too early on the stroke"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.2,1,"Nortje to Theekshana,  1 run","full on off, inside edge on the drive but only one as midwicket dives to his right and gets a good hand on it"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,15.1,1lb,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews, 1 leg bye","back of a length, angled into the pads. Can't get any bat on this but runs the leg bye"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.6,•,"Rabada to Theekshana, no run",Short and Theekshana turns away from it. It's not as short as he thinks as this whizzes past his helmet through to the keeper. Wry smile from the batter
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.5,•,"Rabada to Theekshana, no run","full on the stumps, Theekshana stays deep in the crease and defends"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.4,W,"Rabada to Shanaka, OUT","Swings and misses! This was quick and straight, Shanaka makes room and swings big, but he misses all ends up and Rabada hits - smack dab into the middle of middle"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.3,•,"Rabada to Shanaka, no run","back of a length, 140kph, Shanaka looks to drop this behind point for a quick single but the fielder is quick to it"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.2,1,"Rabada to Angelo Mathews,  1 run",Full and wider of off. Mathews flicks his wrists and punts it over point for one
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,14.1,6,"Rabada to Angelo Mathews,  SIX runs","Oof! Got a hold of this! Greets Rabada with a bang, does Mathews. This was full on off, and Mathews just swings this away over wide long-on. That went far"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.6,•,"Jansen to Shanaka, no run","short of a length, pace-off and angling away from off. Shanaka opens the face and looks to guide this behind square but can't beat slip"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.5,•,"Jansen to Shanaka, no run","Full on off, 136kph, from over the wicket. Opens the face on the drive, but it's straight to point"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.4,6,"Jansen to Shanaka,  SIX runs","Shanaka finds the short boundary! Short ball and Shanaka goes after it. Top edge, but it sails over the shorter fine leg boundary!"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.3,•,"Jansen to Shanaka, no run","back of a length on off, 124kph slower ball, defended back towards the bowler"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.2,1,"Jansen to Angelo Mathews,  1 run","Another short one, angled in straighter. Once more half pulled away, in the air, behind square for one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,13.1,1,"Jansen to Shanaka,  1 run","Top edge and safe! This was short of a length on off, angled in from wide of the crease. Shanaka looks to pull this but has to adjust as the ball holds up in the surface. Falls safe behind square leg"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,12.6,•,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews, no run","good length on the stumps, gets forward and turns this straight towards short midwicket"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,12.5,6,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews,  SIX runs",First six of the innings! Skips down the track and lofts this straight over long-off. 50 up for SL too
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,12.4,•,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews, no run",goes back and punches this but it's straight at short mid-on
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,12.3,•,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews, no run","good length, 82kph, on the stumps. Sticks a bit in the surface as Mathews lunges forward to defend"

1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,11.5,•,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews, no run","Hooks and misses! This was short, 142kph. Mathews goes for it but doesn't get anything on it as it goes over his shoulder"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,11.4,•,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews, no run","back of a length, nipping in. Defensive push towards midwicket"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,11.3,1,"Nortje to Shanaka,  1 run","good length on middle and leg, tucked in front of square leg for one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,11.2,W,"Nortje to Asalanka, OUT","Flicked and straight to the man in the deep! Just like Kamindu earlier, Asalanka whips this off the pads. Catches it cleanly but it's right down Hendrick's throat at deep square leg. Sri Lanka are down for the count"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,11.1,1,"Nortje to Angelo Mathews,  1 run","back of a length angled in, tucked through midwicket for one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.6,2,"Maharaj to Asalanka,  2 runs",Edged past a diving slip! Zips off the surface as Asalanka looks to cut this late. Edge doesn't really give slip a chance though
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.5,•,"Maharaj to Asalanka, no run","Nearly a run out! Good length outside off, goes back and punches this towards point. They think about scurrying a tight single, but Asalanka is turned back and needs a dive here to see him home. Direct hit would've seen him gone. Brilliant work in the field as well"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.4,1,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews,  1 run","shorter outside off, stands tall and punches this into the covers"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.3,•,"Maharaj to Angelo Mathews, no run","full and quicker on the stumps, defended with a full face"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.2,1,"Maharaj to Asalanka,  1 run","length ball, swept towards deep backward square from around off stump"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,10.1,•,"Maharaj to Asalanka, no run",Leading edge! But falls well short of Maharaj as Asalanka lunges out at this
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.6,W,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis, OUT","Kusal goes! This is turning into embarrassing territory. Kusal just has not found any sort of timing and as he tries to launch this one over the square leg boundary, can only get a very imperfect connection that goes hiiiigh towards fine leg. Tristan Stubbs is down there, tracking it against the sunlight, but making sure he gets under it and completes the catch."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.5,1lb,"Nortje to Asalanka, 1 leg bye","length ball on the legs, which Asalanka tries to turn around the corner. Hits his pad and they scamper a leg bye"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.4,•,"Nortje to Asalanka, no run","fullish outside off, pushed back towards the bowler who fields it on his follow through"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.3,1,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","length ball outside off, fended past short third for a single"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.2,2,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis,  2 runs","back of a length ball on about leg, and Kusal drags this aerially over midwicket - an ugly hack - but it gets him a couple at least"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,9.1,•,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis, no run","yorker, at 144kph, all Kusal can do is dig this out back towards the bowler"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.6,1,"Maharaj to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","shortish, but flat, just wide of off. Kusal goes back and hacks it to deep midwicket"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.5,1,"Maharaj to Asalanka,  1 run","tossed up wide of off, pushed through point for a single"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.4,2,"Maharaj to Asalanka,  2 runs","floated up on the stumps to the lefty, Asalanka gets across and glances it past the keeper and gets two for it."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.3,W,"Maharaj to Samarawickrama, OUT","two in two! Sri Lanka are falling apart. This was not necessarily a great ball, and not even an aggressive shot. This is a quickish delivery headed towards off, and Sadeera, without a lot of foot movement, tries to squirt this through off. He lets the ball slip between bat and pad though, and it clatters into off. Uff, Sri Lanka are struggling bad."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.2,W,"Maharaj to Hasaranga, OUT","gone! Hasaranga down the track to Maharaj straight away trying to bash this one down the ground. But he doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, and although there's not much turn, there's enough to take it away from his shot, and QdK flicks the bails off before Hasaranga can make an attempt at returning to the crease. South Africa are bossing this! Hasaranga's promotion has not worked."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,8.1,1,"Maharaj to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","darted in at the stumps, turned towards midwicket"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.6,•,"Nortje to Hasaranga, no run","short ball just outside off, fended defensively towards point, on the hop. Nasty one to get first up"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.5,W,"Nortje to Kamindu Mendis, OUT","Kamindu Mendis is gone! They just can't get power into these shotst. This was length on the stumps, that Kamindu gets across and tries to flick over square leg. Doesn't clear the boundary though. Doesn't even get close. The fielder there takes a simple catch, about 10 metres in from the rope. He was hitting ot the longer side."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.4,1,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","finally gets some bat to ball, but it's not convincing! This is a ball on the thigh pad that Kusal tried to swing over the legside. Gets a terrible connection and that would have been a simple catch for a square leg, but there's no fielder there"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.3,•,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis, no run","back of a length over the stumps, Mendis shuffles to off this time and tries to help this over his shoulder but he again cannot connect, perhaps beaten by pace that time"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.2,•,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis, no run","pretty much a repeat of the previous shot. Short ball wide of off, and he goes deep in the crease again and tries to smash but not a touch on that"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,7.1,•,"Nortje to Kusal Mendis, no run","back of a length ball wide of off, Kusal tries to bash this over midwicket but the bounce does him in for the umpteenth time. Misses"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.6,1,"Maharaj to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","no timing! This is a shorter delivery, and Mendis gets deep in his crease to try and club it over deep midwicket but cannot get any sort of momentum into his shot. Drops halfway between the 30-yard circle and the deep fielder and they only get another single."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.5,1,"Maharaj to Kamindu Mendis,  1 run","flatter ball slightly wide of off, goes back and chops it to the cover sweeper. That outfield is seriously slow"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.4,1,"Maharaj to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","quick one on the stumps again. Kusal goes back plays it under the eyes, and drops it towards midwicket for another quick single"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.3,1,"Maharaj to Kamindu Mendis,  1 run","trots down the pitch to another dart, this time on the stumps, pushed to mid on for one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.2,2,"Maharaj to Kamindu Mendis,  2 runs","reverse sweep here, flatter outside off again. Beats short third but the slow outfield gives him only two"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,6.1,•,"Maharaj to Kamindu Mendis, no run","flatter delivery outside off, not a lot of turn but it beats the batter's prod"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.6,2,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis,  2 runs","runs at Baartman, out of frustration than anything. And opens up his shoulders and clubs this over cover, without a lot of timing. Doesn't clear the fielder by that much and they spring two"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.5,•,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis, no run","wonderful. This is like a Test match so far. Length ball that jags back in, hits Mendis on the pads and raises a big appeal. That was maybe bouncing over, or perhaps seaming too far. No review from South Africa"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.4,•,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis, no run","even better! Angled in, seaming away, missing off by a few centimetres, as Mendis' forward defence again gets beaten. Squared him up properly this time"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.3,•,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis, no run","play and miss again, in the channel, nibbling away off the seam, and Mendis' forward defence is not good enough to get a touch"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.2,1,"Baartman to Kamindu Mendis,  1 run","fuller, on the stumps, driven without a lot of timing past the bowler, and they sprint one as mid off comes around to clean up"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,5.1,•,"Baartman to Kamindu Mendis, no run","beauty! This is almost a test-match delivery, length ball, just seaming away, beating the left-hander's outside edge as he attempts to defend."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.6,1,"Rabada to Kamindu Mendis,  1 run","length outside off, dropped towards deep third and they scramble one"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.5,4,"Rabada to Kamindu Mendis, FOUR runs","a big shot and a rare success for Sri Lanka in this powerplay. This was full on the pads, and Kamindu plays a pick up shot over square leg, makes an excellent connection , and gets a one-bounce four. High risk shot, but Sri Lanka need boundaries desperately"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.4,1,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis,  1 run","length ball on the stumps, Kusal backs away and tries to hack it through the legside, but gets an under edge that goes to midwicket. The fielder shies at the stumps but that's a comfortable single"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.3,1,"Rabada to Kamindu Mendis,  1 run","finally gets a run, off his sixth ball. This was fuller and closer to the stumps. Kamindu opens the face and squirts it to point, and a slight misfield allows him to get a run"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.2,•,"Rabada to Kamindu Mendis, no run","more swing and more swinging and missing. This is fullish, well outside off stump (Rabada is coming around the wicket to the leftie), and Kamindu throws his bat, but the swing takes it away from the outside edge"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,4.1,•,"Rabada to Kamindu Mendis, no run","length ball wide of off, Kamindu lets that one go through, having shouldered arms"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.6,•,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis, no run","ooof, swinging again! This is full and on the stumps, Mendis just tries to keep this out and just about manages, the ball coming off the outside half of the bat and skidding off towards point"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.5,•,"Baartman to Kusal Mendis, no run","another play and miss, this time because of the swing. this is fullish and wide, and there's plenty of curve in the air, and Mendis' big lofted drive does not connect"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.4,1lb,"Baartman to Kamindu Mendis, 1 leg bye","length ball on the pads, pitching outside the stumps and heading to leg. Kamindu tries to turn it around the corner but it hits pad and dribbles away down leg. They take a leg bye"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.3,•,"Baartman to Kamindu Mendis, no run","play and a miss, this is a length ball outside off, which Kamindu offers a defensive shot to. Has his outside edge beaten"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.2,•,"Baartman to Kamindu Mendis, no run","full ball on the stumps to start, poked towards cover"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,3.1,W,"Baartman to Nissanka, OUT","he gets a wicket off his first World Cup delivery. This was fullish, wide, and Nissanka's eyes lit up. He threw his bat at it, but as has been the case right through these early overs, he underestimated the bounce (Baartman, like the other SA bowlers, is a tall man). Gets a thick edge and it flies pretty much directly to deep third, who barely moves a couple of metres. That pressure had been building."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.6,•,"Jansen to Kusal Mendis, no run","length ball just outside off, Mendis tries to chop it to deep third again, but gets a thick under edge and the ball doesn't go far"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.5,2,"Jansen to Kusal Mendis,  2 runs","full just outside off, opens the face and slices this just in front of point and this is a slooow outfield, so they can only get a couple"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.4,•,"Jansen to Kusal Mendis, no run","short of a length outside off, Mendis tries to run it off the face of the bat but doesn't connect"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.3,•,"Jansen to Kusal Mendis, no run","full outside off, drilled to cover. This time the fielder makes a clean stop"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.3,1w,"Jansen to Kusal Mendis, 1 wide","short ball, but poorly directed. This is down leg"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.2,1,"Jansen to Nissanka,  1 run","struck hard and straight to mid off, but a misfield allows a single. This was full and well outside off, drilled to mid off and the fielder there only gets a knee to it and allows a single"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,2.1,•,"Jansen to Nissanka, no run","length on the stumps, defended to leg"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.6,•,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis, no run","biiig swing and a miss. It's the bounce that is troubling Sri Lanka at the moment. Mendis tried to smash this fullish ball over wide mid on, but the bounce and perhaps a little seam movement takes it past the outside edge."
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.6,1w,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis, 1 wide","short ball, but misfired down leg"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.5,•,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis, no run","length ball on the pads, poked square on the leg side but the fielders are all over it so no chance of a run"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.4,•,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis, no run","length ball, angled in and jagging in as well. That's a beauty.  Mendis is leaden footed as he defends and it whizzes between bat and pad and bounces over the stumps"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.3,1,"Rabada to Nissanka,  1 run","length ball just outside off, opens the face and runs it to deep third"
1415704,4,D,South Africa,Sri Lanka,1,1.2,1,"Rabada to Kusal Mendis,  1 run",back of a length tighter into the stumps. Defended from the crease and they take a single into the infield
