1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,19.4,W,"Wiese to Shakeel, OUT","All over! Short and wide outside off again, Shakeel backs away and slashes it straight to backward point. Wiese finishes with three as Oman are bowled out for 109"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,19.3,4,"Wiese to Shakeel, FOUR runs","Banged short and outside off, Shakeel stays back and hacks it over short third"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,19.2,•,"Wiese to Shakeel, no run","Very full on off, dug out back towards the bowler"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,19.1,4,"Wiese to Shakeel, FOUR runs","Erasmus tries twice and does not succeed on both occasions. Shakeel treats Wiese as a fast offspinner and charges him to hit over covers. The Namibia skipper gives it the chase, slides and pulls the ball back but it still goes on with the momentum and makes contact with the boundary cushions"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.6,1,"Trumpelmann to Shakeel,  1 run","Charges down and gets a thick outside edge to deep third. No five-for for Trumpelmann but what a spell, his best in T20Is"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.5,•,"Trumpelmann to Shakeel, no run","Full and outside off, Shakeel looks to go over off but is beaten"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.4,1,"Trumpelmann to Bilal Khan,  1 run","Full and angling in on the front pad, he gets a thick inside edge and the ball rolls to deep third off his pads"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.3,W,"Trumpelmann to Kaleemullah, OUT","Trapped lbw! No need to review this, as the ump gives it straightaway. Length ball in line of the stumps, Kaleemullah gets across but misses his nudge. Hits him low on the front pad, fourth strike for Trumpelmann"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.2,1,"Trumpelmann to Shakeel,  1 run","Chaos! Rolls his fingers on the length ball outside off, Shakeel gets a thick outside edge to short third. He is ball-watching even as his partner comes almost to him for a run, is sent back. The short third fielder throws it to Trumpelmann, who has all the time in the world to take aim and hit the stumps at the bowler's end but he misses, eventually conceding a run"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,18.1,1,"Trumpelmann to Kaleemullah,  1 run","Angled in on a length, clipped through square leg"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,17.4,W,"Wiese to Mehran Khan, OUT","LBW? Nope says the umpire, Wiese wants a review. Goes wide of the crease and angles a length ball in from outside off, Mehran looks to heave it across but completely misses it and is hit on the thigh pad of the back leg. Is height a factor? Not at all, three reds on the Hawk-Eye and Wiese exults as soon as he spots it on the big screen"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,17.3,1,"Wiese to Shakeel,  1 run","LIfts off from a length just outside off, gets Shakeel on his glove and to the off side"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,17.2,W,"Wiese to Khalid Kail, OUT","What a catch, Wiese! The big man's still got it. Goes pace on this time, on a length on off, and the surface helps him. Kail looks to force it back but the ball holds on the surface and he lobs it back. Wiese gets forward and low down in his follow-through and takes it with a tumble"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,17.1,6,"Wiese to Khalid Kail,  SIX runs","Fetch that! That has gone a long, long way. The knuckle ball outside off, 109kph, on a length, Kail clears his front leg and deposits it way over long-on"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.6,•,"Lungameni to Mehran Khan, no run","Length ball outside off, once again Mehran is down the wicket but misses it because it bounces lower than he expects"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.5,•,"Lungameni to Mehran Khan, no run","Now Lungameni anticipates another charge and bowls a bumper, Mehran charges down and has to duck"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.4,4,"Lungameni to Mehran Khan, FOUR runs",Excellent contact this time. Anticipates another length ball and gets his dancing shoes on. Charges down and hits it well over the bowler's head. No chance of long-off coming around. A boundary after 44 balls
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.3,1,"Lungameni to Khalid Kail,  1 run",Cuts it towards backward point for a quick run
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.2,1,"Lungameni to Mehran Khan,  1 run","Dropped after a valiant effort. Frylink charges in from long-off, gets down low but fails to hang on. Mehran looked to loft the length ball from Lungameni but hit it almost too well to long-off"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,16.1,•,"Lungameni to Mehran Khan, no run","Length ball outside off, punched towards cover"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,15.6,2,"Erasmus to Khalid Kail,  2 runs",Another length ball punched through midwicket

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,15.2,1,"Erasmus to Mehran Khan,  1 run","Quicker on leg, flicked through midwicket"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,15.1,W,"Erasmus to Nadeem, OUT","Prolonged appeal and Erasmus gets the decision in his favour. Nadeem wants to review but Oman have none left. Erasmus lands it on a length and spins it in just a touch, beating the batter on the inside edge and rapping him o the front pad. The only question was if it pitched in line. Looks to be the case and a good decision that from umpire Joel Wilson. Three reds, shows the Hawk-Eye"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,14.6,•,"Scholtz to Khalid Kail, no run","Spins away from wide outside off, he cuts it towards backward point where Smit dives and saves runs"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,14.5,1,"Scholtz to Nadeem,  1 run","Length on middle, worked away wide of short fine"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,11.6,W,"Erasmus to Ayaan Khan, OUT","Erasmus gets on the board and celebrations are back in the Namibia camp. Ayaan's adventurousness does not pay off. Charges down to bash it over the bowler, but he is done in by the flight and the lack of pace in it. Skies it high and long-off settles under it"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,11.5,1,"Erasmus to Khalid Kail,  1 run","Slows it down, bowls it on a length on leg, Kali looks to turn it across but gets an inside edge onto the pad and it rolls to the off side"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,10.5,1w,"Lungameni to Ayaan Khan, 1 wide","Slides it down leg from a length, Ayaan misses the flick. The keeper collects that and puts out an appeal but given wide"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,9.1,4,"Erasmus to Khalid Kail, FOUR runs","Drilled through covers. All timing this. Very full outside off, Kail creams it through cover to beat sweeping rushing to his right"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,7.2,1,"Erasmus to Ayaan Khan,  1 run","Edged but no slip. Ayaan comes forward to defend but gets it off the outside edge wide of short third. Turn for Erasmus, who bowled that at 94.4kph"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,6.3,W,"Scholtz to Maqsood, OUT","Trapped him! Scholtz gets the big man Maqsood, who reviews. Tossed up outside off, fullish length, it spins back in. Maqsood looks to whip it across the line with the spin but perhaps it spins in more than he anticipated. Gets beaten on the inside edge and is struck on the back leg that is in front of the stumps. Three reds on Ball-Tracker and Oman lose both their reviews"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,6.2,1,"Scholtz to Khalid Kail,  1 run","Fuller on off and middle, eased down to long-off"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,4.6,4,"Trumpelmann to Maqsood, FOUR runs","Bashed away with some swag! Bowled on a length on middle, Maqsood whip-pulls it through forward square leg, beating the man rushing to his right in the deep. He swung himself off his feet while hitting it. Almost Rishabh Pant-esque"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,4.4,4,"Trumpelmann to Maqsood, FOUR runs","Superb shot. Length ball, in the slot, Maqsood flicks it nonchalantly over midwicket after giving him the charge"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,2.3,W,"Trumpelmann to Naseem Khushi, OUT","A third for rockstar Trumpelmann! Bowls the hard length outside off from around the wicket, despite getting enough swing from over the wicket in the previous over. Khushi is in an attacking mode and looks to take him on. He looks to loft it over the ring on the off side but the bounce is good on this Bridgetown surface. Gets a tad big on him, lobs a catch to mid-off from high of his bat"

1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,0.2,W,"Trumpelmann to Aqib, OUT","Toe-crusher, and that is as plumb as it gets! What a start for Trumpelmann and Namibia. He's rocking the long mane and has a new look, with the head-band on, but the menace with the new ball from left-arm over the wicket to the right-hander stays. Spears it full and straight on middle, and it hits Ilyas full on the front leg, even before he could dig it out. A review wasted as well for Oman"
1415703,3,B,Namibia,Oman,1,0.1,W,"Trumpelmann to Prajapati, OUT","Strikes first ball! A peach to begin Namibia's T20 World Cup campaign. The perfect left-arm fast bowler's dismissal. Full and straight on middle and leg, just swinging in late a touch. Prajapati looks to flick it across but is done in by the inswing, late one that. Gets rapped low on the front pad. The umpire did not have to be convinced a lot. Raises his finger immediately and Trumpelmann is off the mark in this T20 World Cup! Prajapati chats with his partner about the review but has been sent walking"
