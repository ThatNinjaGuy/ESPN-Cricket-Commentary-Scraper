1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.6,1b,"Kyewuta to Russell, 1 bye","just a bye to end the innings! Gets the wide yorker right and Russell cannot make contact. Perhaps a little late in jamming his bat down, and WI have to settle for a bye off the last ball"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.5,4,"Kyewuta to Russell, FOUR runs","four more! Russell has that wide yorker line figured out now. This falls short of a yorker and Russell, flashing hard at it, slices it over short third!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.4,4,"Kyewuta to Russell, FOUR runs","flies away to the fence! In the slot outside off. Russell almost swings himself off his feet and while he does not middle it, the outside edge hurtles away past the keeper!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.4,1w,"Kyewuta to Russell, 1 wide","full and wide outside off again. Too wide, in fact. Beyond the tramlines and some more exercise for the umpire"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.3,4,"Kyewuta to Russell, FOUR runs",four more! Full and wide outside off. The width allows Russell to throw the kitchen sink at it and flay it over backward point!

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,19.1,4,"Kyewuta to Russell, FOUR runs","Russell finds the fence! Goes for the wide yorker but misses by a smidgen on the shorter side. Russell, sitting deep in his crease, can get under it and blasts it past deep cover point!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,18.6,1,"Miyagi to Russell,  1 run",pin-point yorker on off. Russell can only drag it towards deep mid wicket

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,18.3,2,"Miyagi to Shepherd,  2 runs",low full toss just outside off. Shepherd cannot get under it but powers it enough to long off's left for a couple of runs
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,18.2,2,"Miyagi to Shepherd,  2 runs",very full on off. Shepherd plants his front foot and whips it back past the bowler. Bags a brace for his toil

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.6,1lb,"Kyewuta to Russell, 1 leg bye",oh dear! Thigh-high full toss on leg stump. Russell almost seems to lose the trajectory. Swings at it anyway and the ball trickles off his back thigh into the off side
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.6,5nb,"Kyewuta to Russell, (no ball) FOUR runs",edged and four! Full outside off. Russell swings his blade like an axe again and gets a thick outside edge that flies past the keeper!  And it looks like Kyewuta has overstepped too...
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.5,•,"Kyewuta to Russell, no run",oh! In the slot outside off. Russell plants his front foot and tries to tonk that into next week. Only connects with fresh air
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.5,2w,"Kyewuta to Shepherd, 2 wide",speared way down leg. Shepherd leaves it and the keeper cannot gather cleanly either. Two extras added to WI's total
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.4,•,"Kyewuta to Shepherd, no run","full toss on middle and off. Shepherd pats it back at the bowler, who in trying to collect and throw it back at the stumps, misfields. No damage done and Kyewuta gives Shepherd a stare as well"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,17.3,W,"Kyewuta to Rutherford, OUT","cleans him up with a cracker, and gives Rutherford a send-off too! Sizzling yorker on leg stump. Rutherford, it seems, is not expecting it and even if he was, that was just too good. Awfully late in getting his bat down and the ball thunders into leg stump. WI keep losing wickets!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,15.3,W,"Masaba to Powell, OUT","Masaba gets the WI captain! This is also shortish outside off and Powell looks to go up and over extra cover. Cannot quite get under it, though, and fails to get the elevation he desires. Obuya leaps up at extra cover and snaffles up a sharp chance above his head!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,14.1,4,"Nakrani to Rutherford, FOUR runs","starts off the over with a boundary! Off-pace but this is too short on middle and leg. Rutherford picks it, delays his stroke and pulls it past deep backward square leg!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,12.4,W,"Nakrani to Charles, OUT","Charles' struggles come to an end! Sort of summed up by the fact that he has gotten out to a full toss. He could have hit it anywhere but he is almost taken by surprise. Gets it high on the bat and plonks it straight to long on. Intent was not an issue for Charles tonight, but execution was!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,12.1,2,"Nakrani to Powell,  2 runs","fullish, slanting into the pads. Powell bunts it with enough pace towards deep mid wicket and can saunter back for the second"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,11.6,•,"Ramjani to Charles, no run",oh! Slightly slower on a length outside off. Charles tries to hit it into the ocean but only swats away a few flies

Powell comes out of his bunker and seems to not be to the pitch of the ball. Goes through with the swing, though, and smokes it a 107m over long on. That was effortless!"

Pooran looks for the big heave over cow corner but the ball seems to skid on just a shade quicker than he expects. Cannot complete his swing and the ball skews up off the top edge.

King opts to stay back, possibly playing the trajectory rather than the length. The ball skids on with the arm and King is hurried into his stroke. The ball goes past the bat, kisses the pad and then disturbs the furniture. Big wicket for Uganda!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,4.2,4,"Ramjani to King, FOUR runs","brilliant! A bit of a drag-down but it was intended to tuck King up for room. He stepped so far outside leg, though, that he still had some room to work with. Drilled to mid off's left!"

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,2.3,1nb,"Miyagi to Charles, (no ball)","peach! Back of a length in the sixth stump channel. Pitches and leaves the batter, beating Charles comprehensively on the outside. But hang on...looks like Miyagi has overstepped, quite comfortably too..."

1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,2.1,4,"Miyagi to King, FOUR runs","shot! Shortish outside off and King cashes in. Stands up on his toes, gets his hands through the ball and cracks it past extra cover!"
1415718,18,C,West Indies,Uganda,1,1.6,4,"Kyewuta to Charles, FOUR runs",that has been laced! Fractionally short outside off and there is width on offer too. Charles backs away to create even more room and crashes it over cover!
