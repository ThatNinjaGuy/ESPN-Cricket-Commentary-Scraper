1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.6,1,"Netravalkar to Shadab,  1 run","USA win by five runs! The first upset of the 2024 T20 World Cup. The USA players make their presence feel by yelling their feelings out. Their dugout is up in celebration and ecstacy, even as the Pakistan dressing room is left wondering what would have been. Netravalkar, the man assigned the job, finished it off with a full ball which angled away and finished in the channel outside off. Shadab could only drag it as far as deep point"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.5,2,"Netravalkar to Shadab,  2 runs","Ahh, well bowled! This is a nice yorker angling across towards middle and off, and Shadab is able to loft it only as far as between long-off and long-on. They pinch two"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.4,4lb,"Netravalkar to Shadab, 4 leg byes","Ohh, lucky four for Pakistan! Shadab got across the stumps to try and sweep this, but the ball dribbled off his toes between the keeper and short third"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.4,1w,"Netravalkar to Shadab, 1 wide","And it is another wide. This is angled across, and lands on a yorker length wide of off. Shadab lets it go"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.3,W,"Netravalkar to Iftikhar, OUT","Wow, superb catch! Sub fielder Milind Kumar takes a great catch! Placed at long-off, he took a few steps forward before going low and grabbing it barely above the ground. The final verdict will be given by the third umpire, though. He sees multiple replays, with the ball almost hinting to drop off his hands on impact. Now the TV umpire looks at it from a different angle. The ball is dipping and dying on to Nitish, who uses both his hands to try and catch that. And after much ado, it is given out!"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.3,1w,"Netravalkar to Iftikhar, 1 wide","This is a wide! This time Ifthikar doesn't move much, and sees this yorker-length ball wide of off go past him. He leaves it alone, and it is given wide"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.2,4,"Netravalkar to Iftikhar, FOUR runs","thumped between long-on and deep midwicket! Netravalkar bowled on a length on middle and off, but Iftikhar waited before pulling hard in the gap for four"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.1,â€¢,"Netravalkar to Iftikhar, no run","Iftikhar gets across, and the bowler follows. Netravalkar goes fullish and angles it across, with the ball finishing wide of off. But Iftikhar was far too across as he attempted to loft, but missed. So wide not called"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.6,1W,"Amir to Aaron Jones, 1 run, OUT","Amir looks for the yorker. It's at the stumps and is clipped through square leg. Jones returns for the second, which is never on, and fails to make it. But he had to of course"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.6,3w,"Amir to Aaron Jones, 3 wide","5head leave from Jones. Buzzers too, USA are doing this with unforced errors. Jones cleared the front leg but saw the fullish ball, going away with the angle, to be outside the tramline and let it pass. The batters ran as Rizwan lobbed it high up, too far for Amir to collect but no one backing up either. They steal two byes!"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.5,2,"Amir to Aaron Jones,  2 runs","Into the pitch, wide too. Jones connects with the cut. Sweeper runs to the right, Amir yells as they return for the second on the throw (which was to the keeper's end)"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.5,2w,"Amir to Harmeet Singh, 2 wide","Amir misses, Harmeet misses. Everyone's disappointed but this is in USA's favour. Low full toss swung down leg, went past the attempted flick. Another bye stolen"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.4,1,"Amir to Aaron Jones,  1 run","Jones goes across to try and get inside the line. Gets a low full toss at the stumps, flicks it to deep square leg. Just a single"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.4,2w,"Amir to Harmeet Singh, 2 wide","Amir misses his line (and length) and concedes a wide plus bye. Could have been worse but Harmeet missed the flick on the low full toss going down leg. Rizwan can't collect cleanly, they run one"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.3,1,"Amir to Aaron Jones,  1 run","Pakistan, like they did at the death, go with the yorker plan. This is nailed. Pace-on again. Jones can't do nothin with that. Jams it a foot or two in front but that allows a scampered s"
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.2,2,"Amir to Aaron Jones,  2 runs",Nails the on-pace yorker but Jones manages to skilfully drill the flick through midwicket. They scamper back for two as well
1415711,11,A,United States Of America,Pakistan,3,0.1,4,"Amir to Aaron Jones, FOUR runs","Amir starts with the wide one but Jones is able to reach it. It was slow and into the pitch, slashed wide of third for four. Big advantage for USA!"
